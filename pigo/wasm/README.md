## WASM (Webassembly) integration

**Important notice: in order to run the Webassembly demo at least Go 1.13 is required!**

Starting from **v1.4.0** Pigo has been ported to Webassembly ðŸŽ‰. This proves the library real time performance capabilities.

This also means that for real time face detection it's not needed anymore to run the library in a Python environment as a shared library. For more details check the project description from the [Readme](https://github.com/hdm/facecrime/pigo#real-time-face-detection-running-as-a-shared-object) file and also read this [blog post](https://esimov.com/2019/11/pupilseyes-localization-in-the-pigo-face-detection-library) for a more detailed explanation.

## How to run it?

In order to run the WASM demo is as simple as to type the <kbd>make</kbd> command inside the `wasm` folder. This will build the `wasm` file and at the same time will start a new webserver. That's all. It will automatically open a new page in your default browser under the following address: `http://localhost:5000/`.

In case the `lib.wasm` is not getting generated automatically you can build it yourself by running the following command:

```bash
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o lib.wasm wasm.go
```
### Supported keys:
<kbd>s</kbd> - Show/hide pupils<br/>
<kbd>c</kbd> - Circle through the detection shape types (`rectangle`|`circle`|`ellipse`)<br/>
<kbd>f</kbd> - Show/hide facial landmark points (hidden by default)
